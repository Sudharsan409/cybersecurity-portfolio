# 🔎 1. Gobuster — Directory Enumeration

### 🎯 Objective

Discover hidden directories and files hosted by the web server.

<details>
<summary>💻 Command</summary>

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<TARGET_IP>:8080 \
-w /usr/share/wordlists/wordlists/wordlist.txt
```

</details>

### 🔧 Options Explained

| Option | Description                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `dir`  | Runs Gobuster in directory enumeration mode   |
| `-u`   | Defines the target URL                        |
| `-w`   | Specifies the wordlist used for brute forcing |

### 🧠 Why This Command?

The challenge description hinted that hidden resources existed:

> "The rooms it never lists are the ones worth finding."

Directory enumeration was performed to identify hidden endpoints and exposed files.

### ✅ Result

Discovered:

```
/.git
/app.js
```

The exposed `.git` directory became the primary attack vector.

# 📥 2. Wget — Download Exposed Git Repository

### 🎯 Objective

Retrieve the publicly accessible `.git` directory from the web server.

<details>
<summary>💻 Command</summary>

```bash
wget -r -np -R "index.html*" http://<TARGET_IP>:8080/.git/
```

</details>

### 🔧 Options Explained

| Option | Description                                             |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-r`   | Enables recursive downloading                           |
| `-np`  | Prevents downloading files outside the target directory |
| `-R`   | Rejects files matching a specific pattern               |

### 🧠 Why These Options?

The `.git` directory contains multiple nested objects and metadata files.

* `-r` was required to download the complete repository structure
* `-np` restricted downloads to the exposed `.git` directory only
* `-R "index.html*"` removed unnecessary auto-generated directory pages

### ✅ Result

The exposed repository was successfully downloaded locally.

# 🔧 3. Git Checkout — Restore Repository Files

### 🎯 Objective

Recover the original project files from the downloaded Git repository.

<details>
<summary>💻 Command</summary>

```bash
git checkout -- .
```

</details>

### 🔧 Options Explained

| Option | Description                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--`   | Separates Git options from file paths                       |
| `.`    | Applies the operation to all files in the current directory |

### 🧠 Why This Command?

The downloaded `.git` directory contains Git metadata but not the visible working files.

Running:

```bash
git checkout -- .
```

restores the tracked files from the repository.

### ✅ Result

Recovered files:

```
README.md
app.js
index.html
```

The flag was discovered inside:

```
README.md
```

# 🛡️ Security Impact

| Vulnerability                | Risk                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Exposed `.git` directory     | Source code disclosure       |
| Missing deployment hardening | Internal information leakage |
| Public repository metadata   | Possible secret exposure     |

---

# 🔐 Defensive Recommendations

✅ Block `.git` access at the web server level
✅ Remove development files before deployment
✅ Implement security testing during CI/CD pipelines
✅ Perform regular vulnerability assessments
