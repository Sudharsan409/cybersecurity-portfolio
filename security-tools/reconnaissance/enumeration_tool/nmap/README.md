## ⚠️ Legal and safety notice

Only scan systems and networks that you own or have explicit permission to test.

Nmap is a legitimate network administration and security-auditing tool, but scanning third-party infrastructure can violate laws, contracts, acceptable-use policies, or monitoring rules. Some NSE scripts can be intrusive, exploit vulnerabilities, perform brute-force checks, or cause service disruption.

For learning, use:

- Your own machines/VMs
- A deliberately vulnerable lab
- A CTF/lab platform that explicitly permits scanning
- `scanme.nmap.org` for Nmap's authorized demonstration target, while respecting its usage policy

This README intentionally explains advanced capabilities, but examples should be adapted only to authorized targets.

# 1. What is Nmap?

**Nmap (Network Mapper)** is an open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.

It can help answer questions such as:

- Which hosts are alive?
- Which TCP/UDP ports are reachable?
- Which services appear to be listening?
- What software/version appears to be running?
- What operating system/device type is likely?
- Which firewall/filtering behavior is visible?
- Which NSE checks provide additional information?
- How does the network topology look?

Nmap is useful for:

- Network inventory
- Troubleshooting
- Service discovery
- Security assessments
- Vulnerability validation
- Configuration auditing
- Incident-response investigation
- Lab and CTF learning
- Monitoring changes over time

Nmap's official reference guide documents the command-line interface and is the authoritative source for exact behavior.

---

# 2. Mental model

Think of an Nmap assessment as a pipeline:

```text
Targets
   │
   ▼
Host discovery
   │
   ├── host appears down ──► stop (unless -Pn)
   │
   ▼
Port scan
   │
   ▼
Port states
   │
   ▼
Service/version detection (-sV)
   │
   ▼
OS detection (-O)
   │
   ▼
NSE scripts (--script)
   │
   ▼
Traceroute (-traceroute)
   │
   ▼
Output (-oA / -oX / -oN / -oG)
```

A common mistake is jumping straight to `-A` for every task. A better approach is to start with the smallest scan that answers the question, then increase scope.

---

# 3. Installation

## Linux

Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap
```

Fedora/RHEL-family systems:

```bash
sudo dnf install nmap
```

Arch:

```bash
sudo pacman -S nmap
```

## macOS

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install nmap
```

## Windows

Download the official installer from:

https://nmap.org/download.html

Windows installations commonly use **Npcap** for packet capture/raw networking functionality.

## Build from source

Use the official Nmap source and build instructions:

https://nmap.org/book/inst-source.html

---

# 4. Verify installation

```bash
nmap --version
```

or:

```bash
nmap -V
```

Show help:

```bash
nmap -h
```

Show the complete command-line reference:

```bash
man nmap
```

On many systems:

```bash
nmap --help
```

Check NSE installation:

```bash
nmap --script-help default
```

---

# 5. Command structure

General form:

```bash
nmap [Scan Type(s)] [Options] <target>
```

Examples:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.10
nmap example.com
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
nmap -sV -p 1-1000 192.168.1.10
nmap -O 192.168.1.10
nmap -A 192.168.1.10
```

A useful way to think about a command:

```text
nmap
 ├── what to scan?       target
 ├── which hosts?        discovery options
 ├── which ports?        -p / --top-ports / -F
 ├── how to scan?        -sS / -sT / -sU / ...
 ├── identify service?   -sV
 ├── identify OS?        -O
 ├── run scripts?        -sC / --script
 ├── speed?              -T*
 └── save results?       -oA / -oX / -oN / -oG
```

---

# 6. Target specification

## Single host

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.10
```

## Hostname

```bash
nmap server.example.com
```

## Multiple targets

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.20 192.168.1.30
```

## CIDR network

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

A `/24` normally represents 256 IPv4 addresses.

## IP ranges

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.1-50
```

Multiple octet ranges are possible:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1-3.1-254
```

Use carefully: ranges can become very large.

## Wildcards

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.*
```

## Input file

```bash
nmap -iL targets.txt
```

Example `targets.txt`:

```text
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.20
server01.example.internal
```

## Exclude targets

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1
```

Multiple exclusions:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1,192.168.1.254
```

Exclude from a file:

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --excludefile exclude.txt
```

## Random targets

```bash
nmap -iR 10
```

Use this only in environments where the generated targets are explicitly authorized.

## List targets without scanning

```bash
nmap -sL 192.168.1.0/24
```

This is excellent for checking that your target expression means what you think it means.

---

# 7. Host discovery

Host discovery answers:

> "Which targets appear to be online?"

## Ping scan

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

`-sn` performs host discovery without a normal port scan.

## Skip host discovery

```bash
nmap -Pn 192.168.1.10
```

Useful when ICMP or discovery probes are blocked.

Important: `-Pn` can make a large scan much slower because Nmap treats every specified target as potentially online.

## TCP SYN discovery

```bash
nmap -sn -PS443 192.168.1.0/24
```

Multiple ports:

```bash
nmap -sn -PS22,80,443 192.168.1.0/24
```

## TCP ACK discovery

```bash
nmap -sn -PA80,443 192.168.1.0/24
```

## ICMP echo

```bash
nmap -sn -PE 192.168.1.0/24
```

## ICMP timestamp

```bash
nmap -sn -PP 192.168.1.0/24
```

## ICMP address mask

```bash
nmap -sn -PM 192.168.1.0/24
```

## UDP discovery

```bash
nmap -sn -PU53,161 192.168.1.0/24
```

## SCTP INIT discovery

```bash
nmap -sn -PY80 192.168.1.0/24
```

## IP protocol discovery

```bash
nmap -sn -PO1,2,4 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Disable implicit ARP/ND discovery

```bash
nmap -sn --disable-arp-ping 192.168.1.0/24
```

For local Ethernet networks, Nmap normally uses ARP/IPv6 Neighbor Discovery because it is highly effective.

## Discovery reason

```bash
nmap -sn --reason 192.168.1.0/24
```

---

# 8. Port states

Nmap commonly reports:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `open` | An application appears to be listening |
| `closed` | Reachable, but no application is listening |
| `filtered` | Filtering prevents Nmap from determining open/closed |
| `unfiltered` | Reachable, but Nmap cannot determine open/closed with that scan |
| `open|filtered` | Could be open or filtered |
| `closed|filtered` | Could be closed or filtered |

### Important

`open` does **not** mean "vulnerable".

`filtered` does **not** necessarily mean "secure".

Nmap is reporting observations from a particular scan technique, port, protocol, and network path.

---

# 9. Port selection

## Default scan

```bash
nmap 192.168.1.10
```

## Specific port

```bash
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.10
```

## Multiple ports

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## Range

```bash
nmap -p 1-1024 192.168.1.10
```

## All TCP ports

```bash
nmap -p- 192.168.1.10
```

Equivalent conceptually to:

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.1.10
```

## Top ports

```bash
nmap --top-ports 100 192.168.1.10
```

## Fast scan

```bash
nmap -F 192.168.1.10
```

`-F` scans fewer ports than the normal default port set.

## TCP-only port list

```bash
nmap -p T:22,80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## UDP-only port list

```bash
nmap -p U:53,67,68,123,161 192.168.1.10
```

## TCP and UDP together

```bash
nmap -p T:80,443,U:53,161 192.168.1.10
```

## Service-name port specification

```bash
nmap -p http,https,ssh 192.168.1.10
```

## Exclude ports

```bash
nmap -p 1-1000 --exclude-ports 80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## Port ranges with exclusions

```bash
nmap -p 1-65535 --exclude-ports 22,25,110 192.168.1.10
```

## Scan ports in numerical order

```bash
nmap -r 192.168.1.10
```

Nmap normally randomizes the scan order.

---

# 10. Port scanning techniques

Nmap supports multiple scanning methods. Choose based on your authorized assessment objective and network conditions.

## SYN scan — `-sS`

```bash
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.10
```

Commonly called a "half-open" scan. It sends TCP SYN probes and analyzes responses without completing a normal TCP connection in the usual case.

Often the default privileged TCP scan.

## TCP connect scan — `-sT`

```bash
nmap -sT 192.168.1.10
```

Uses the operating system's TCP connect mechanism. Useful when raw-packet privileges are unavailable.

## UDP scan — `-sU`

```bash
sudo nmap -sU 192.168.1.10
```

UDP scanning can be significantly slower than TCP scanning because many UDP services do not respond to unsolicited probes.

Target a smaller UDP set first:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -p 53,67,68,123,161 192.168.1.10
```

## FIN scan — `-sF`

```bash
sudo nmap -sF 192.168.1.10
```

Uses TCP FIN probes and can be useful for characterizing TCP filtering behavior on some systems.

## NULL scan — `-sN`

```bash
sudo nmap -sN 192.168.1.10
```

Sends TCP packets with no TCP flags set.

## Xmas scan — `-sX`

```bash
sudo nmap -sX 192.168.1.10
```

Sets FIN, PSH, and URG TCP flags.

## ACK scan — `-sA`

```bash
sudo nmap -sA 192.168.1.10
```

Primarily useful for mapping filtering behavior rather than determining open ports.

## Window scan — `-sW`

```bash
sudo nmap -sW 192.168.1.10
```

A variation of ACK scanning that uses TCP window information on some stacks.

## Maimon scan — `-sM`

```bash
sudo nmap -sM 192.168.1.10
```

Uses FIN/ACK behavior and is useful mainly for specialized TCP-stack analysis.

## SCTP INIT scan — `-sY`

```bash
sudo nmap -sY 192.168.1.10
```

## SCTP COOKIE-ECHO scan — `-sZ`

```bash
sudo nmap -sZ 192.168.1.10
```

## IP protocol scan — `-sO`

```bash
sudo nmap -sO 192.168.1.10
```

This identifies supported IP protocols rather than TCP/UDP listening ports.

## FTP bounce — `-b`

FTP bounce scanning is a legacy/deprecated technique and is generally not appropriate for modern assessments.

---

# 11. Service and version detection

## Basic version detection

```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
```

Nmap probes discovered services and attempts to identify the application and version.

## Light version detection

```bash
nmap -sV --version-light 192.168.1.10
```

Equivalent to low version-scan intensity.

## Maximum version detection

```bash
nmap -sV --version-all 192.168.1.10
```

## Explicit intensity

```bash
nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 192.168.1.10
```

Valid intensity range:

```text
0–9
```

Default intensity is typically `7`.

## Version tracing

```bash
nmap -sV --version-trace 192.168.1.10
```

Useful for understanding why a service was or was not identified.

## Scan all ports during version detection

```bash
nmap -sV --allports -p- 192.168.1.10
```

Use carefully because version detection across every port can be expensive.

## Service detection with selected ports

```bash
nmap -sV -p 22,25,53,80,110,443,3306 192.168.1.10
```

---

# 12. OS detection

## Basic OS detection

```bash
sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.10
```

## OS + service + scripts + traceroute

```bash
sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.10
```

`-A` enables:

- OS detection
- Version detection
- Default NSE scripts
- Traceroute

It is convenient, but broader and noisier than a focused scan.

## Aggressive OS guessing

```bash
sudo nmap -O --osscan-guess 192.168.1.10
```

Alias:

```bash
sudo nmap -O --fuzzy 192.168.1.10
```

## Limit OS detection

```bash
sudo nmap -O --osscan-limit 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Maximum OS detection retries

```bash
sudo nmap -O --max-os-tries 1 192.168.1.10
```

Lower values can improve speed at the cost of accuracy.

---

# 13. Nmap scripts / NSE

The **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** extends Nmap using Lua scripts.

NSE can perform:

- Discovery
- Service enumeration
- Metadata collection
- Version enrichment
- Configuration checks
- Vulnerability checks
- Authentication-related checks
- Brute-force testing
- Some exploitation tasks

Use scripts according to their documentation and your authorization.

Official NSE documentation:

https://nmap.org/nsedoc/

## Default scripts

```bash
nmap -sC 192.168.1.10
```

Equivalent:

```bash
nmap --script=default 192.168.1.10
```

## Specific script

```bash
nmap --script http-title -p 80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## Multiple scripts

```bash
nmap --script http-title,http-headers -p 80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## Script category

```bash
nmap --script safe 192.168.1.10
```

## Vulnerability scripts

Only run against systems you are authorized to test:

```bash
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.10
```

## Discovery scripts

```bash
nmap --script discovery 192.168.1.10
```

## Version scripts

```bash
nmap --script version 192.168.1.10
```

## Combine categories

```bash
nmap --script "safe,discovery" 192.168.1.10
```

## Script exclusion

```bash
nmap --script "default and not intrusive" 192.168.1.10
```

NSE script selection expressions support Boolean operators such as:

```text
and
or
not
```

---

# 14. Timing and performance

Nmap has dynamic timing algorithms plus timing templates.

## Timing templates

| Template | Name | General idea |
|---|---|---|
| `-T0` | paranoid | Extremely slow |
| `-T1` | sneaky | Very slow |
| `-T2` | polite | Slower / lower network load |
| `-T3` | normal | Default |
| `-T4` | aggressive | Faster on reliable networks |
| `-T5` | insane | Very aggressive; accuracy may suffer |

Example:

```bash
nmap -T4 192.168.1.0/24
```

Do not assume faster is better. Rate limits, packet loss, congestion, firewalls, and fragile devices can make aggressive scans less reliable.

## Host timeout

```bash
nmap --host-timeout 30m 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Minimum packet rate

```bash
nmap --min-rate 100 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Maximum packet rate

```bash
nmap --max-rate 500 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Scan delay

```bash
nmap --scan-delay 100ms 192.168.1.10
```

## Maximum scan delay

```bash
nmap --max-scan-delay 1s 192.168.1.10
```

## Minimum parallelism

```bash
nmap --min-parallelism 10 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Maximum parallelism

```bash
nmap --max-parallelism 100 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Maximum retries

```bash
nmap --max-retries 2 192.168.1.10
```

## Initial RTT timeout

```bash
nmap --initial-rtt-timeout 100ms 192.168.1.10
```

## Minimum RTT timeout

```bash
nmap --min-rtt-timeout 100ms 192.168.1.10
```

## Maximum RTT timeout

```bash
nmap --max-rtt-timeout 500ms 192.168.1.10
```

Use manual timing controls carefully. Nmap's adaptive timing is usually a better starting point.

---

# 15. Firewall / IDS / packet manipulation

Nmap contains options that alter packet construction and network behavior.

These are advanced features. Do not use them to bypass controls on systems without authorization.

## Fragment packets

```bash
sudo nmap -f 192.168.1.10
```

## Specify MTU

```bash
sudo nmap --mtu 32 192.168.1.10
```

The MTU value must meet Nmap's constraints and should be used only when you understand the network path.

## Decoys

```bash
sudo nmap -D RND:5 192.168.1.10
```

Decoys make traffic appear to originate from multiple source addresses.

Only use this in an authorized lab/assessment where such traffic is permitted.

## Spoof source address

```bash
sudo nmap -S <source-ip> 192.168.1.10
```

This can make responses unusable unless routing is controlled appropriately.

## Source port

```bash
sudo nmap --source-port 53 192.168.1.10
```

## Data length

```bash
sudo nmap --data-length 20 192.168.1.10
```

## Custom hexadecimal payload

```bash
sudo nmap --data 00FFAA 192.168.1.10
```

## Custom string payload

```bash
sudo nmap --data-string "NMAP" 192.168.1.10
```

## MAC address spoofing

```bash
sudo nmap --spoof-mac 0 192.168.1.10
```

Or a vendor prefix/name supported by your Nmap installation.

## Interface selection

```bash
sudo nmap -e eth0 192.168.1.10
```

## Send Ethernet frames

```bash
sudo nmap --send-eth 192.168.1.10
```

## Send IP packets

```bash
sudo nmap --send-ip 192.168.1.10
```

### Important

These features are not a magic "undetectable mode." Network devices, IDS/IPS systems, switches, routers, and endpoint telemetry can still detect scanning behavior.

---

# 16. Output formats

Never rely only on terminal output for serious assessments.

## Normal output

```bash
nmap -oN scan.txt 192.168.1.10
```

## XML

```bash
nmap -oX scan.xml 192.168.1.10
```

XML is useful for programmatic processing.

## Grepable output

```bash
nmap -oG scan.gnmap 192.168.1.10
```

This format is convenient for simple shell pipelines, although XML is usually preferable for robust automation.

## All major formats

```bash
nmap -oA scan 192.168.1.10
```

Creates:

```text
scan.nmap
scan.xml
scan.gnmap
```

## Verbose output

```bash
nmap -v 192.168.1.10
```

More verbosity:

```bash
nmap -vv 192.168.1.10
```

## Debugging

```bash
nmap -d 192.168.1.10
```

More:

```bash
nmap -dd 192.168.1.10
```

## Show reasons

```bash
nmap --reason 192.168.1.10
```

## Show only open/possibly open ports

```bash
nmap --open 192.168.1.10
```

## Packet trace

```bash
sudo nmap --packet-trace -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
```

This is excellent for learning how Nmap works at packet level.

## Append output

```bash
nmap --append-output -oN scan.txt 192.168.1.10
```

## Resume a stopped scan

```bash
nmap --resume scan.nmap
```

## XML stylesheet options

```bash
nmap -oX scan.xml --stylesheet <path-or-url> 192.168.1.10
```

Disable stylesheet association:

```bash
nmap -oX scan.xml --no-stylesheet 192.168.1.10
```

---

# 18. IPv6

Use:

```bash
nmap -6 2001:db8::10
```

Hostname resolving to IPv6:

```bash
nmap -6 server.example.com
```

Combine with service detection:

```bash
nmap -6 -sV 2001:db8::10
```

IPv6 discovery and packet behavior differ from IPv4. Neighbor Discovery is important on local Ethernet networks.

# 19. Useful real-world workflows

## Workflow 1 — Is the host alive?

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.10
```

## Workflow 2 — Discover a subnet

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 -oA discovery
```

## Workflow 3 — Quick TCP assessment

```bash
nmap -T4 --top-ports 100 192.168.1.10
```

## Workflow 4 — Full TCP port inventory

```bash
nmap -sS -p- -T4 192.168.1.10 -oA full-tcp
```

## Workflow 5 — Identify services

```bash
nmap -sV -p 22,80,443,3306 192.168.1.10
```

## Workflow 6 — Identify OS

sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.10
```

## Workflow 7 — Comprehensive assessment

```bash
sudo nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.10
```

Use `-A` when you actually need its breadth.

## Workflow 8 — TCP + UDP inventory

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -sU -p T:22,80,443,U:53,123,161 192.168.1.10
```

```

Then compare with:

```bash
sudo nmap -sS -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.10
```

## Workflow 14 — Learn packet behavior

```bash
sudo nmap --packet-trace -p 80 192.168.1.10
```

# 20. Defensive auditing workflows

Nmap is especially useful when you ask a specific defensive question.

## "What is exposed?"

```bash
nmap -sS -sV --open -p- 192.168.1.10 -oA exposure
```

## "What changed since last month?"

Save both scans:

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -oA before 192.168.1.10
nmap -sS -sV -oA after 192.168.1.10
```

Use Ndiff:

```bash
ndiff before.xml after.xml
```

## "Which servers expose SSH/HTTP/HTTPS?"

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 --open 192.168.1.0/24 -oA services
```

## "Which services reveal versions?"

```bash
nmap -sV --open 192.168.1.0/24 -oA versions
```

## "Which hosts respond?"

```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 -oA hosts
```

# 21. NSE categories

NSE scripts are grouped into categories.

| Category | Typical purpose |
|---|---|
| `auth` | Authentication-related checks |
| `broadcast` | Broadcast-based discovery |
| `brute` | Brute-force authentication testing |
| `default` | Scripts enabled by `-sC` |
| `discovery` | Information discovery |
| `dos` | Denial-of-service testing |
| `exploit` | Exploit-related checks |
| `external` | Uses external services |
| `fuzzer` | Protocol/input fuzzing |
| `info` | Information gathering |
| `intrusive` | More intrusive checks |
| `malware` | Malware-related detection |
| `safe` | Generally safer information checks |
| `version` | Service/version enrichment |
| `vuln` | Vulnerability detection |

The category list and individual script documentation can change as Nmap evolves. Always inspect the installed version's documentation.

---

# 22. NSE discovery and script management

List scripts installed on a typical Linux system:

```bash
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/
```

Find a script:

```bash
find /usr/share/nmap/scripts -name 'http*'
```

Get help for a script:

```bash
nmap --script-help http-title
```

Search installed NSE documentation:

```bash
nmap --script-help "http-*"
```

List scripts by category:

```bash
nmap --script-help vuln
```

Update the NSE script database after installing or changing scripts:

```bash
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```

### Script location

Typical locations vary by OS/package. Nmap also supports custom data directories.

---

# 23. Script arguments

Some NSE scripts accept arguments.

General form:

```bash
nmap --script <script> --script-args '<key=value,...>' <target>
```

Example structure:

```bash
nmap --script <script-name> \
     --script-args '<documented-argument=value>' \
     <authorized-target>
```

Always read the specific script's documentation first:

```bash
nmap --script-help <script-name>
```

Do not guess script arguments.

# 24. Troubleshooting

## Problem: "Host seems down"

Try:

```bash
nmap -Pn <target>
```

But understand that `-Pn` disables normal host discovery.

## Problem: No ports are shown

Try a focused port scan:

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 <target>
```

Then:

```bash
nmap -sV -p 22,80,443 <target>
```

## Problem: UDP scan is very slow

Start small:

```bash
sudo nmap -sU -p 53,123,161 <target>
```

Avoid scanning all 65,535 UDP ports unless the assessment requires it.

## Problem: OS detection failed

Try:

```bash
sudo nmap -O <target>
```

OS fingerprinting generally works better when Nmap can observe suitable open and closed ports.

## Problem: Service is unknown

Try:

```bash
nmap -sV --version-all -p <port> <target>
```

## Problem: Need to understand packets

```bash
sudo nmap --packet-trace -p <port> <target>
```

## Problem: Need more diagnostics

```bash
nmap -vv <target>
```

or:

```bash
nmap -dd <target>
```

## Problem: Results differ between machines

Check:

- Nmap version
- OS
- privileges
- interface
- routing
- firewall
- IPv4 vs IPv6
- packet loss
- timing options
- target changes

Use:

```bash
nmap --iflist
```

to inspect interfaces and routes.

# 25. Performance cookbook

## Fast discovery of a /24

```bash
nmap -sn -T4 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Fast common-port check

```bash
nmap -T4 --top-ports 100 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Full TCP scan

```bash
nmap -sS -p- -T4 192.168.1.10
```

## Full TCP + version detection

```bash
nmap -sS -sV -p- -T4 192.168.1.10
```

This can take substantially longer than a port-only scan.

## Controlled rate

```bash
nmap --max-rate 200 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Avoid unnecessary work

Instead of:

```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.0/24
```

consider:

```bash
nmap -p 22,80,443 --open -sV 192.168.1.0/24
```

if your actual question is simply "which machines expose these services?"

---

# 26. Reading Nmap output

Example:

```text
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd
443/tcp  open   https   nginx
3306/tcp filtered mysql
```

Interpretation:

### `22/tcp`

- Port: `22`
- Protocol: TCP

### `open`

A service appears to be listening.

### `ssh`

Nmap's service-name guess.

### `OpenSSH`

Version detection identified the application family.

### `filtered`

Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because filtering interferes with the scan.

### `VERSION`

Treat detected versions as evidence, not unquestionable truth. Fingerprinting is probabilistic.

---

# 27. Automation

## Bash

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

TARGET="$1"

if [[ -z "$TARGET" ]]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <target>"
  exit 1
fi

nmap -sS -sV --open -oA "scan-${TARGET}" "$TARGET"
```

Use safe filenames in production; raw target strings can contain characters unsuitable for filenames.

## XML processing

Prefer XML when integrating Nmap with scripts:

```bash
nmap -sV -oX scan.xml 192.168.1.10
```

Then parse the XML with your preferred language/library.

## Python

Install a suitable XML parser/library from your environment, then:

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse("scan.xml")
root = tree.getroot()

for host in root.findall("host"):
    address = host.find("address")
    if address is None:
        continue

    ip = address.attrib.get("addr")

    for port in host.findall("./ports/port"):
        state = port.find("state")
        service = port.find("service")

        if state is None:
            continue

        if state.attrib.get("state") == "open":
            name = service.attrib.get("name") if service is not None else "unknown"
            print(ip, port.attrib.get("portid"), name)
```

For serious automation, XML is generally more robust than scraping terminal text.

# Golden rules

1. **Know what you are authorized to scan.**
2. **Start small.**
3. **Discover hosts before scanning everything.**
4. **Choose ports based on the question you are trying to answer.**
5. **Use `-sV` when service identification matters.**
6. **Use `-O` when OS fingerprinting matters.**
7. **Use NSE deliberately; read script documentation first.**
8. **Do not assume `open` means vulnerable.**
9. **Do not assume `filtered` means secure.**
10. **Save results with `-oA` for repeatable assessments.**
11. **Prefer XML for automation.**
12. **Use packet traces to understand what Nmap is actually sending.**
13. **Do not blindly use `-A` everywhere.**
14. **Do not blindly use `-T5`; faster can mean less reliable.**
15. **Validate important findings with another source such as service configuration, packet capture, logs, or authenticated inspection.**
16. **Always check the documentation for the Nmap version you are actually running.**

## One-command progression

A practical progression for a single authorized target:

```bash
# 1. Basic
nmap <target>

# 2. Specific ports
nmap -p 22,80,443 <target>

# 3. Service detection
nmap -sV -p 22,80,443 <target>

# 4. Default NSE
nmap -sC -sV -p 22,80,443 <target>

# 5. Full TCP ports
sudo nmap -sS -p- <target>

# 6. Full TCP + service detection
sudo nmap -sS -sV -p- <target>

# 7. OS detection
sudo nmap -O <target>

# 8. Broad assessment
sudo nmap -A <target>

# 9. Save everything
sudo nmap -sS -sV -O -oA assessment <target>
```

## Final note

This README is designed as a **living Nmap reference**, not a replacement for the official manual.

Nmap evolves. Options, scripts, databases, fingerprints, and defaults can change. For exact behavior, always cross-check your installed version:

```bash
nmap --version
nmap --help
man nmap
```
